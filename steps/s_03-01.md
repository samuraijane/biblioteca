# Biblioteca â€“ Step 03-01

### Objective
Build a very simple UI that is connected to both CSS and JavaScript.

### Instructions
* While in the root of the project, create the following directories with their respective files:
  * `css/` with `style.css`
  * `js/` with `app.js`
  * `public/` with `index.html`
* Add a heading that says "Biblioteca" to the HTML file.
* Add the paths for CSS and JavaScript to `index.html`.
* Modify **server.js** with the middleware it needs so that it can load the files for CSS, JavaScript, and HTML when the browser URL is at `/`.
* Add some scratch code to both `style.css` and `app.js` that lets us know the connection of each of these and the HTML is working as expected.


### Hints
`express.static(__dirname + "/<somePath>")` (you're going to need 3 of these)

### Summary
* When a server sends an HTML file to the client, like we are doing here, it's called _server-side rendering_. As you might expect, there are pros and cons to this and it all depends on the context. For what we are doing, it's exactly what we need.
