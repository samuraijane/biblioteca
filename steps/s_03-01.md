# Biblioteca â€“ Step 03-01

### Objective
Build a very simple UI that is connected to both CSS and JavaScript.

### Directories
Create the following directories:
* _biblioteca/css/_
* _biblioteca/js/_
* _biblioteca/public/_

### Files
#### biblioteca/server.js
* Add code that provides server-side rendering of **index.html** when the browser URL is at `/`.
* Add code that will allow **index.html** to use relative paths to load CSS and JavaScript.

#### css/style.css
* Create this file.
* Add scratch code in order to confirm that the HTML and CSS files are connected.

#### js/app.js
* Create this file.
* Add scratch code in order to confirm that the HTML and JavaScript files are connected.

#### public/index.html
* Create this file.
* Add standard HTML5 boilerlate.
* Add a heading tag that contains "Biblioteca".
* Include the paths for CSS and JavaScript files.

### Command Line
* `touch <someFileNameWithExtension>`

### Before moving to the next step
* Change the scratch code in both **style.css** and **app.js** and verify the changes by refreshing the browser.

### Hints
* `app.use("/<someVirtualPath>", express.static(__dirname + "/<somePath>"))`

### Summary
* When a server sends an HTML file to the client, like we are doing here, it's called _server-side rendering_. As you might expect, there are pros and cons to this and it all depends on the context. For what we are doing, it's exactly what we need.
* It would be perfectly fine to put **style.css** and **app.js** inside of **public/** along with **index.html**. However, putting each in a dedicated directory allows the code to scale more easily. If we decide to use JavaScript modules or integrate a CSS pre-processor on the client, we will be very happy that these files are in separate directories.
