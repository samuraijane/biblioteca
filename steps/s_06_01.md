# Biblioteca – Step 06-01 [Work-in-Progress]

### Objective
Use `sequelize-cli` to automate the creation of the database and the `User` model.

### Directories
In previous steps we've used `mkdir` when creating a new directory but this time, we'll `npx sequelize-cli init` to create the **config/**, **migrations/**, **models/**, and **seeders/** directories.

### Files
#### biblioteca/.env
Add the key/value pairs that `sequelize` needs to build the database– `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_LOCAL_SERVER`

#### config/config.js
* Update the values for `username`, `database`, and `dialect` for the `development` object.

#### seeders/<someTimeStamp>-user.js
* Add at least 3 objects to populate the database with some fake data.

### Command Line
Add NPM dependencies
* `sequelize` as production dependencies (see notes in Summary below)

### Before moving to the next step
* Verify that the data is writing to the database by accessing it directly with a shell.

### Hints
* Add the foundation files and directories that `sequelize` needs before building the database with `npx sequelize-cli init`
* Create the database with `npx sequelize-cli db:create` (`sequelize` references **config.json** to do this)
* Create the User model with `npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes firstName:string,lastName:string,email:string,gitHubID:integer,gitHubUsername:string` (this creates the **models/** directory and the files it contains)
* Create the `User` table in the database with `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`
* Add the template for a seed file, which will later be used to add rows to the `User` table in the database with `npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name user`
* Seed the database with data by entering `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all` (remember, you must have data objects in seeders/<someTimeStamp>-user.js in order for this to properly add rows to the database)
* in case you make a mistake
  * `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo`
  * `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo`


### Summary
* When you install `sequelize`, you may get a warning that you also need to install `pg` and `pg-hstore`. If so, install those packages, as well.
* Be sure that the database server is running before entering any `npx sequelize-cli` commands.
