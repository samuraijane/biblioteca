# Biblioteca â€“ Step 06-01 [Work-in-Progress]

### Objective
Use `sequelize-cli` to automate the creation of the database.

### Directories
In previous steps we've used `mkdir` when creating a new directory but this time, we'll `npx sequelize-cli init` to create config/, migrations/, models/, and seeders/

### Files
#### config/config.js
* Update the values for `username`, `database`, and `dialect` for the `development` object.

#### seeders/<someTimeStamp>-user.js
* Add at least 3 objects to populate the database with some fake data.

### Command Line
Add NPM dependencies
* `dotenv` as a production dependency.

### Before moving to the next step


___

### Hints
* `npx sequelize-cli init` (creates the 4 directories we need)
* `npx sequelize-cli db:create` (creates the database, make sure db is postgres is running)
* `npx sequelize-cli npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes firstName:string,lastName:string,email:string,gitHubID:integer,gitHubUsername:string` (creates the User model)
* `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` (creates the User table in the db)
* `npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name user` (adds a file to the seeders/ directory)
* `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all` (add rows to the databse based on the contents of the file in seeders/)
* in case you make mistake
  * `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo`
  * `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo`
