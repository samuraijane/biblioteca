| **database** | add a table for book ids to the database                                  |
| **server**   | modify the endpoint so that it saves book id to the database              |

## Files
#### apiBooks.js
* Import the model for `ApiBook`.
* Modify the `/api/books/:id` endpoint by implement a function that handles saving the book id to the database. If the ID is already present, respond with an appropriate message. If the ID isn't present, add it to the table and respond with a message that lets the user know it has been saved.

#### migrations/<someTimeStamp>-create-api-book.js
#### models/apibook.js
* Create a model and a migration that includes `apiBookID`, `apiSource`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
* One CLI command creates both of these files.

## Command Line
* `npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name ApiBook --attributes apiBookID:string,apiSource:string`
* `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`

## Before moving to the next step
Verify in the PostgreSQL shell that clicking the "Add to library" button saves the corresponding book id to the database.

## Hints
to be determined

## Summary
* It is always difficult to anticipate how the application will scale but with a little planning we can be better prepared. We've named the model `ApiBook` because it's possible we will want a separate model in the future to hold data that is not available in the Open Library API (or any other book API for that matter). In this case, we will want a separate model and table with different fields, the values of which we will populate on our own.
