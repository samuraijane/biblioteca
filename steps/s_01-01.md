# Biblioteca â€“ Step 01-01

### Objective
Set the initial foundation from which we will build the application.

### Directories
Create the following directory:
* _biblioteca/_

### Files
#### biblioteca/.gitignore
* Create this file.
* We will add files and directories to it as we build but if you are on a Mac, add a line to ignore **.DS_Store** now.

#### biblioteca/LICENSE.md
* Create this file.
* Add the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) replacing the placeholders with your name and the year.

#### biblioteca/README.md
* Create this file.
* Add the name of the application, _Biblioteca_ and format it as an h1.

#### biblioteca/server.js
* Create this file.
* We will not add anything to it at this time.

### Command Line
* Initialize the project with NPM in order to create **package.json**.

___

### Hints
* `cd <path/to/directory>`
* `mkdir <someDirectoryName>`
* `npm init -y`
* `touch <someFileNameWithExtension>`

### Summary
* A license let users know how the software may be used. It also tells others, including those that are reviewing your resume, that you understand why a license is important. We're using MIT because it's common and widely recognized. There are many other open source licenses available or you can create your own.
* By creating the files before initializing the project with NPM, **package.json** automatically populates a number of keys with values that describe the application. The most noticeable of these is a _start_ script which has been defined for us.
* We use **.gitignore** for each directory and file that we wish to keep out of version control. This is particularly important when it comes to storing credentials that our application needs and which should remain hidden from view in GitHub.
