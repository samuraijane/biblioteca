# Biblioteca â€“ Step 01-01

### Objective
Set the initial foundation from which we will build the application.

### Instructions
* Create a directory and name it _biblioteca_.
* Inside of `biblioteca/`, create the following files:
  * .gitignore
  * LICENSE.md
  * README.md
  * server.js
* Initialize the project with NPM in order to create **package.json**.
* We will add files and directories to **.gitignore** as we build. If you are on a mac, add ".DS_Store".
* Add the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) to **LICENSE.md**.
* Add the name of the application, _biblioteca_ to **README.md** and be sure to format it as an h1.
* For this step, we will not add anything to **server.js**.

### Hints
`cd <path/to/directory>`
`mkdir <someDirectoryName>`
`npm init -y`
`touch <someFileNameWithExtension>`

### Summary
* By including a license, you let users know how the software may be used. It also tells others, including those that are reviewing your resume, that you understand why a license is important. We're using MIT beause it's common but it's not the only one out there. You an also create your own license but most open source software uses a license that has already been written.
* By creating the files listed in the instructions above before initializing the project with NPM, **package.json** automatically populates a number of keys with values that describe the application. The most noticeable of these is a _start_ script which has been defined for us.
