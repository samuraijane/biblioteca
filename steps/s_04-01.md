# Biblioteca â€“ Step 04-01

### Objective
Create an endpoint to GET books from the Open Library API and separate routes into a dedicated directory.

### Directories
Create the following directory:
* _biblioteca/api/_

### Files
#### api/apiBooks.js
* Create this file.
* Add an endpoint for `/api/books` that responds to a GET request searching for `author` and `title` values.
* Destructure these fields from the request body.
* The response should be limited to a maximum of 10 results and return the book data that match the search criteria.

#### api/apiHeartbeat.js
* Create this file.
* Remove the `/heartbeat` endpoint in **server.js** and add it to this file with a new endpoint of `api/heartbeat`.

#### biblioteca/server.js
* Import the dependencies that allow us to parse the request body as well as fetch data from third-party APIs.
* Import the api files that contain the new endpoints.
* Use middleware so that the app is able to use JSON parse which comes with `body-parser`.
* Create routes that delegate functionality to the imported api files. 

### Command Line
Add NPM dependencies
* `body-parser` and `node-fetch` as production dependencies.

### Before moving to the next step
* Use Postman to hit both endpoints and verify they work as expected.
* When hitting `api/books`, make sure the code does not break if you send only one key/value pair.
* Remove the scratch CSS and JS code we added in step 03-01. We no longer need this code since we verified earlier that **index.html** can see both the stylesheet and the JavaScript file.

### Summary
* `body-parser` is an absolute must to read the data coming in through the request body.
* `node-fetch` works very much like JavaScript's `fetch`. See the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) for more details.
* There are multiple ways to handle routing. The solution we have provided here passes in values used by the exported functions. But is also very common to use `express.Router()` which you can read more about [here](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html).
* It's important to note that, for now, we are not concerned with error handling but we will address this later.
* Read the documentation for the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev) to learn how this API works.
