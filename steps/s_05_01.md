# Biblioteca â€“ Step 05-01 [Work-in-Progress]

### Objective
Use the `dotenv` package and a **.env** file to hide the `PORT` that the server is running on.

### Directories
n/a

### Files
#### biblioteca/.env
* Create this file.
* Add a value for `PORT` that equals `3001`.

#### biblioteca/server.js
* _Import_ `dotenv` and instantiate its config method at the top of the file.
* Replace the hardcoded _3001_ values at the bottom of this file with the help of the `dotenv` package and don't forget to use string interpolation for the message output to the console. 

### Command Line
Add NPM dependencies
* `dotenv` as a production dependency.

### Before moving to the next step


___

### Hints
`process.env.PORT`

### Summary
**.env** is the file that contains everything that should not be in version control and it's what we use to make sure that others cannot see its contents by looking at or cloning the repository. While it is not really necessary to put `PORT` in this file, this is practice so that when we do come to values that can compromise the security of your application, you will know how to hide them. At the same time, it is useful to put different URLs and `PORT` values in **.env** in order to switch more easily between development and production environments.
