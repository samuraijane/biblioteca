# Biblioteca â€“ Step 09-01 [Work-in-Progress]

### Objective
Add authentication to the app (yes, this is big one, lots going on here)

### Directories
Create _auth/strategy/_

### Files
#### auth/index.js
* Add `passport` as the second argument that this export receives
* Add the redirect callback that GitHub use after an authentication attempt
* Modify the `/auth/github` endpoint so that it now uses GitHub to authenticate the login

#### strategy/github.js
* Create this file.
* Add a GitHub strategy.

#### biblioteca/server.js
* import the `passport` and `express-session` dependencies
* import the file for the GitHub strategy that we have created in **strategy/github.js**
* Add middleware so that `passport.initialize()` and `passport.session()` are being used by the application
* To suppress deprecation warnings you might receive in the console, add boolean values for `resave` and `saveUninitialized` to the object passed into `session`
* Add middleware so that `passport` uses the GitHub strategy
* Modify the arguments that you pass into `auth` so that the second one is now `passport`

### Command Line
Dependecies
* `express-session`
* `passport`
* `passport-github`

### Before moving to the next step

### Hints


### Summary
* Once **server.js** is aware of the GitHub strategy, you will be prompted to install `pg` if you have not done so previously.
