## Files
#### apiBooks.js
* Add an endoint, `/api/books/:id` that receives a book's ID and uses it to query the Open Library API in order to retrieve the book data. Further configure this endpoint to respond to the client with a simple message that the book has been found in the Open Library API database.
* Include a `.catch` in case there are errors with the request to the Open Library API.

#### app.js
* Because the book ID in the Open Library API database has more than we need (e.g. `/works/OL17549585W`), implement a reusable function that returns the text after the trailing slash and use it for both the `afterTrailingSlash` constant and to extract the actual book ID (e.g. `OL17549585W`) before sending it to the server.
* Add a button to each book in the results list that sends its ID to the server at `/api/books/:id`.
* Reuse the function we wrote several steps ago to execute this POST but with different values for its parameters.
