# Biblioteca â€“ Step 02-01

### Objective
Add server-related dependencies and build a simple server with one endpoint.

### Instructions
* While in the root of the project, install `express` as a production dependency.
* Add `nodemon` as a development dependency.
* Add "node_modules/" to **.gitignore**.
* Change the `start` script in **package.json** so that `nodemon` starts the server instead of `node`.
* Add code to **server.js** that builds a simple server, as follows:
  * runs on port 3001
  * logs a message to the console that the server is running
  * has an endpoint at `/heartbeat` that responds to a GET request with a JSON object
* Start the server and verify that the endpoint is working as expected with Postman.

### Hints
`npm install <someProductionDependency>`
`npm install --save-dev <someDevelopmentDependency>`
`npm run <someScriptKey>`

### Summary
* One of the advantages to building a server at the start of a project is that it allows us to find and resolve any bugs that may arise before we get too deep into client-side code. We'll have bugs there, as well, but if we know the server is solid, then we have only to look in one place instead of two.
* The **node_modules/** directory is added to a project the first time we add a dependency. The code in this directory should never be committed to source control which is why this step includes adding it to our **.gitignore** file.
