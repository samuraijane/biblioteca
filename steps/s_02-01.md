# Biblioteca â€“ Step 02-01

### Objective
Add server-related dependencies and build a simple server with one endpoint.

### Directories
n/a

### Files
#### .gitignore
Add a line to hide the **node_modules/** directory.

#### package.json
Change the `start` script so that `nodemon` starts the server instead of `node`.

#### server.js
Build a very simple server, as follows:
* runs on port 3001
* logs a message to the console that the server is running
* has an endpoint at `/heartbeat` that responds to a GET request with a simple JSON object

### Command Line
Add NPM dependencies
* `express` as a production dependency.
* `nodemon` as a development dependency.

### Before moving to the next step
* Start the server and verify with Postman that the `/heartbeat` endpoint is working as expected.

### Summary
* One of the advantages to building a server at the start of a project is that it allows us to find and resolve any bugs that may arise before we get too deep into client-side code. We'll have bugs there, as well, but if we know the server is solid, then we have only to look in one place instead of two.
* The **node_modules/** directory is added to a project the first time we add a dependency. The code in this directory should never be committed to source control which is why this step includes adding it to our **.gitignore** file.
* When installing dependencies, you will eventually see a **package-lock.json** file. You should commit this to source control but it's best practice if you commit it separate from other files so that tracking the history of the dependencies is easier.
