## Files
#### style.css
* Add a top and bottom margin to the `<li>` elements inside of the `<ul>` so that the list is easier to read in the UI when the results are returned.

#### app.js
* Instead of logging the search results to the console, write a resuable function that will append them to the DOM (see Hints below).

#### search.ejs
* In order for the client to know where to append the search results, add an ID attribute to `<main>`.

## Command Line

## Hints
* A reusable function has parameters whose values determine what the function ultimately does. Although at this step, we need only a function that can loop through an array of book objects in the response and add them as `<li>` elements to the DOM, we can also use it to add other element types via its parameters.
* To add a new element to the DOM, we need to know the `id` of an element already in the DOM.
* It is also a good idea to pass in a string that will be a class attribute for the newly created element. This way, we can use CSS to style it.
* Of course, we have to pass in the data that we get back from the response so that the code knows not only the content of each `<li>` but how many to generate.
* Lastly, if pass in a `type`, we can use this same function to generate more than just `<li>` elements should the need arise.
* At the moment, we are return data from the server in exactly the same format that the server receives it from the API and the API uses `author_name` as an array so we have to use `author_name` and `[0]` to get the author's name. The Open Library API is probably using an array because one book can have more than one author. For now, though, we will simply pull the first author in the list.
