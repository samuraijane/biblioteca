# Biblioteca
_Biblioteca_ is a self-guided tutorial for students learning to create a full-stack application that includes a front-end UI, a server that handles requests with authentication, and a database to persist user data.

### Concept
The application allows a user to build his or her own personal library collection using data available from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev). Please note that since this resource does not require an API key, showing how to include one in a request is not part of this tutorial.

### Tech Stack
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript (vanilla)
* Node
* PosgreSQL
* Sequelize
* Vanilla

### Prerequisites
* You should at least have had an introduction to each of the technologies listed above.
* Patience, and lots of it. You're going to make mistakes and things are going to break. You're allowed to scream at your computer but don't give upâ€“ you'll get there.
* Familiarity with the command line, we use it a lot here.

### Workflow
We have grouped the overarching steps into a series of folders which are essentially mini-lessons that build the application. The README files provide instructions and hints that you can use as a starting point to complete each lesson. We encourage you to follow them as you work and then compare your solution to the one provided. If you're in a hurry and want to jump ahead to the solution, the README file can help you deconstruct our approach and allow you to more clearly understand what's going on.
