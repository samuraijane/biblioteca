# Biblioteca
_Biblioteca_ is a self-guided tutorial for students learning to create a full-stack application that includes a front-end UI, a server that handles requests with authentication, and a database to persist user data.

### Concept
The application allows a user to build his or her own personal library collection using data available from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev). Please note that since this resource does not require an API key, showing how to include one in a request is not part of this tutorial.

### Tech Stack
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Node
* PosgreSQL
* Sequelize

### Prerequisites
* You should at least have had an introduction to each of the technologies listed above.
* Patience, and lots of it. You're going to make mistakes and things are going to break. You're allowed to scream at your computer but don't give upâ€“ you'll get there.
* Familiarity with the command line, we use it a lot here.

### Workflow
Each filename in the **steps/** directory corresponds to a branch in this repo which shows the completed solution. Please note that the instructions contained within the step files (e.g. **s_01-01.md**) are not written in a strictly linear fashion. The idea here is to give the student enough information to build the application while also providing opportunities for problem solving (which is where the real learning happens). The student will benefit most by building each step first, as per the step file, and then comparing his or her solution to the one provided.

### Should I clone this repo?
Unless you want to have copy of it for reference on your own computer, there is no need to clone this repo. As you are building everything from scratch, the primary purpose of it is to provide a step-by-step overview of how to build a full-stack application which, after completing, you can compare to your own code.
